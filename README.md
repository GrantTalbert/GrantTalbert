### <samp>I'm Grant Talbert</samp>

- Undergrad class of '27
- Double major in physics & math
    - Focusing on quantum mechanics, want to go into high energy physics
    - My math major is mostly for fun, I like abstract nonsense, topology, and algebra
- I ❤️ LaTeX
- LINUX (i use arch btw)
- ~~furry~~ *normal human being wdym*

On this account you ~~can~~ *will soon be able to* find (when I finish organizing my github)
- My various LaTeX templates, including a custom package I made to give myself various custom titlepages
- My dotfiles, aka the various configuration files and scripts I made for my computer
    - This includes a management system for my LaTeX notes and homework files. This system an adaptation/expansion of [Gilles Castel (RIP)](https://castel.dev/)'s system.
    - I [refactored his figure management system into rust](https://github.com/GrantTalbert/inkscape-figure-manager/), and intend to do the same with his entire setup. This refactor is for Linux systems, and may break on other operating systems because I simply don't care. 
- Many of the notes I've taken in my university courses
- Notes I've taken from other sources, such as textbooks, or miscellanious lectures I have attended

I have a <a href="https://github.com/TheHolyChickn">second account</a> for online communities, where I usually go by the alias The Holy Chicken. My second account hosts my Minecraft mod, <a href="https://github.com/TheHolyChickn/Good-Mod">good mod</a>, which is a small QOL mod for Hypixel Skyblock that improves over other mods in a very specific niche.

### Languages i sort of kinda know
- Python
- Java
- Kotlin
- Bash
- Rust (a little)
- Go (an even smaller amount)
- Typescript (learning)
