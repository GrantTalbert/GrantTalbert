- My dotfiles, aka the various configuration files and scripts I made for my computer
    - This includes a management system for my LaTeX notes and homework files. This system an adaptation/expansion of [Gilles Castel (RIP)](https://castel.dev/)'s system. I intend to refactor it into a language other than Python soon

I have a <a href="https://github.com/TheHolyChickn">second account</a> for online communities, where I usually go by the alias The Holy Chicken. My second account hosts my Minecraft mod, <a href="https://github.com/TheHolyChickn/Good-Mod">good mod</a>, which is a small QOL mod for Hypixel Skyblock that improves over other mods in a very specific niche.
